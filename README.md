# C# Socket
## Introduction
I implemented Socket communication by C#.

 "ConsoleApp1" includes the code of client-side and "ConsoleApp2" includes the code of server-side. They are  asynchronous  socket communication.  After linking, client-side will send string "location" to server-side. And server-side will return a position coordinate to client-side.
